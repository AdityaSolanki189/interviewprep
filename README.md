# interviewprep
A [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) markdown vault containing all of the study notes I made whilst prepping to interview in Summer 2021. Accompanying blog post coming shortly.

To view these files correctly, install Obsidian and import the root folder as a vault. View `Intro.md` for more info and a table of contents.
